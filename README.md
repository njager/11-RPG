A basic 3D RPG made in Godot for Indiana University's MSCH-C220. 

Includes enemy agents that follow and attack the player, collectable coins that result in a win condition when all are collected, 3D movement with jumping and a basic attack, a diegetically enclosed playing space, and a user-created mesh with a PBR material.
